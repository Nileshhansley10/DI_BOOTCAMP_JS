                "Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians,<br> 
                 a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.<br>
                 Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as<br> 
                 Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,<br>
                 which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms.<br>
                 When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard<br>
                 (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,<br>
                 stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.<br>
                 Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers,<br>
                 "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
